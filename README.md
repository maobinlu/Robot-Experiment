# Robot-Experiment
Mobile robots experiment for a connectivity control game.

This video demonstrates the motion process of four velocity-actuated robots, which are in a connectivity control game. The objective of each robot is to minimize its own cost function, which depends on the positions of the robots. As we can see in the video, the position of each robot will converge to the Nash equilibrium, and its velocity will diminish to zero.
